COMPILED CODE:
Menu.java in my Dropbox. 
To compile, javac Menu.java
To run, java Menu

REPORT:
Menu.java works by creating a public class called Menu. Menu has one public method, main.
It initializes the counts for 5 items: chicken, fish, steak, beer, and wine. It sets the prices
for each item, and initializes the totals before and after tax, along with the subTotal.
Then, the method displays a menu of the items with numbers and prompts the user to pick an item
based on the number, or 0 to complete the order. If the selection is not between 0 and 5, the 
method prompts the user for a vaid input. For every input, the program adds to the counts and 
totals for the items and whole order. Once 0 is pressed, the method calculates the tax, and adds
it to the final total. It then prints out the final order, in numbers of each item, number of
total items, the subtotal, the tax, the total, and then a thank you message.
